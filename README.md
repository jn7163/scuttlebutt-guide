Have you found an Uncharted Isle? We'd love to hear about it.

## Documentation

**scuttlebot**
  - [scuttlebot.io](http://scuttlebot.io/) - has great details about sbot and ssb-client (and other modules)
  - [ssbc.github.io](https://ssbc.github.io/docs) - a predecessor to scuttlebutt.io, much of the same content, has some other tutorials

**scuttlebutt stack**
  - [scuttlebutt-protocol-guide](https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/) - ([ssb](%gghZe88ZC2N18Zz44cn0/PE12eEJ+vyzOj6CW1QG4Ds=.sha256) | [github](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide)) learn about the protocol with beautiful diagrams
  - [scuttlebutt modules](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/modules.html) - a great overview of modules organised by domain / stack-position

**pull-streams** 
  - [pull-stream.github.io](https://pull-stream.github.io/) - a guide to the pull-stream ecosystem (scuttlebut uses pull-streams extensively)
  - [github.com/pull-stream/pull-stream-faq](https://github.com/pull-stream/pull-stream-faq) - a simple FAQ


## Tutorials

### Videos

Intro to Node
  - video + repo ([ssb](%RQRdvrMM66kAScjCRdmXP0+6GCFkWpYIo2gN1dinax8=.sha256) | [github](https://www.github.com/mixmix/node-intro)) - a rough intro to node

Intro to Scuttlebutt (v2)
  - https://github.com/mixmix/ssb-client-basic no video on this one, but I think you should start here
Intro to Scuttlebutt (v1)
  - `ssb-client` - repo + video ([ssb](%DQVOkekw0Cx7bz0fcV8/WlWlBQHnpLw9LyYp7ctYC/0=.sha256) | [github](https://github.com/mixmix/ssb-client-intro)), learn how to connect to your databaseand do some streaming queries!
  - `flumedb` - repo + video ([ssb](%cC74FteCqofxOwZxIf7fqSeYVHFeXDTmKAQQaPudusY=.sha256) | [github](https://www.github.com/mixmix/flume-intro)), an intro to the database under scuttlebutt, about how to construct some _views_ (reduced versions of the database) for powerful lookups!
  - `scuttlebot` plugins - repo ~~+ video~~ ([ssb](%f2PZYbacgJpNq4buNCVsjG6j55K8olw80QxPjF2Teqs=.sha256) | [github](https://www.github.com/mixmix/ssb-server-plugin-intro)) plug your `flumeview` into scuttlebot (I figured our what went wrong at the end of the flumedb video!)


Intro to Mutant
  - Part 1 - [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcHNobDImK0), introduces observeables with `Value`, and `when`. Make a part of the page toggle dynamically
  - Part 2 - [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYiTYUvX5JM), introduces `computed` which takes in multiple observeables and makes a new observeable, and `Struct` (kind a like an observeable object with pre-defined keys). I focus a bit of refactoring and moving code around to give you an idea of what's possible.

_Mutant is a client side reactive library which is all about mutating the DOM. It's used by Patchwork, Patchbay, Ticktack (and the underlying lib Patchcore)._


### Written
